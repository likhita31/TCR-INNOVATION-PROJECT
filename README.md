# Estimation_of_Product_Subscription_Machine_Learning

The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing
campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in
order to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed (Col -21).

We will create a model with the following steps:
● Import the relevant packages
● Download and explore the dataset
● Prepare the dataset for training
● Use any prediction algorithm based upon the EDA
● Train the model to fit the data
● Make predictions using the trained model
● Create a test case and generate a predicted result from the system
